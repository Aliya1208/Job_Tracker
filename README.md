# Job_Tracker
A personal Job/Internship tracker that I built in Excel 

This tracker inlcudes: 
- Dropdown menu for application status
- Conditional formatting for visual tracking 
- Auto-generated follow up dates
- Filters and a notes section.

I built this tracker as a CIS student looking for a summer internship to stay organized. I'm sharing this as the start of my portfolio.
